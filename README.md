# HeatWave ML Code for Performance Benchmarks

HeatWave is an integrated, massively parallel, high-performance, in-memory query accelerator for MySQL Database Service that accelerates performance of MySQL by orders of magnitude for analytics and mixed workloads. It is the only service that enables you to run OLTP and OLAP workloads simultaneously and directly from your MySQL database, without any changes to your applications. This eliminates the need for complex, time-consuming, and expensive data movement and integration with a separate analytics database. Your applications connect to the HeatWave cluster through standard MySQL protocols.

MySQL HeatWave users currently do not have an easy way of creating machine-learning models for their data in the database, or generating predictions and explanations for it. Such users, while being database experts, frequently are relatively new to Machine Learning and can benefit from products that streamline the creation and usage of machine learning models. HeatWave ML is the product that addresses this need.

This set of benchmarks is based around popularly used datasets in Machine Learning fetched from multiple sources.

After you have downloaded a benchmark, run the preprocess.py script with the benchmark name as below
```
python3 heatwave-ml/preprocess.py --benchmark <name>
```

## Running a benchmark
Launch MySQL Shell as below
```
mysqlsh user@hostname --mysql --sql
```
On the mysql-shell prompt, run
```
> source heatwave-ml/<benchmark_name>.sql
```
where <benchmark_name> is a name from the above table. The train and test csvs generated above should
be present in the current directory in MySQL Shell. Each SQL file will create the schemas for a benchmark,
train a HeatWave ML model on it, and score the model on the test data. The test score will be output at the e
end.

## Running scalability experiments
In order to run scalability numbers for HeatWave ML, for the benchmarks above, run the ML_TRAIN commands from the sql files above for each benchmark on 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 nodes. Measure the end-to-end training time (ML_TRAIN time from MySQL client perspective) for each configuration (benchmark + number of nodes). Graphing the number of nodes against the runtime on each node should give the scalability for a benchmark.
