They can create vectors from documents stored in a local file system. Customers can deploy these AI applications on premise or migrate them to MySQL HeatWave for lower cost, higher performance, richer functionality and latest LLMs with no change to their application. This gives developers the flexibility to build their applications on MySQL EE and then deploy them either on premise or in the cloud."
