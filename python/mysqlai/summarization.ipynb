       "\"The 2024 Summer Olympic Games, held in Paris, France, saw significant milestones and challenges. The games featured 10,500 Olympians from 206 territories and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Refugee Olympic Team, with China and the United States having the largest delegations. The games highlighted issues of representation, equality, cost control, and home advantage.\\n\\nThe number of countries participating in the Olympics has increased over time, but there was a notable decrease in 1980 due to the American-led boycott of the Moscow games. The Paris games saw four countries winning their first-ever medals, including Saint Lucia's Julien Alfred who won gold in the women's 100m sprint.\\n\\nThe distribution of medals among top-performing countries reversed slightly from previous Olympics, with China and the United States claiming the most medals. However, when considering victory ratios, Kenya, North Korea, and Saint Lucia outperformed traditional Olympic giants.\\n\\nThe Paris games also saw a significant increase in prize money for athletes, with some sports introducing new compensation policies. The IOC maintains an amateur competition policy, but individual sport federations have autonomy over their allocated funds. Some countries, like Hong Kong, offered generous medal compensation schemes, while others did not compensate their medallists at all.\\n\\nThe games were also marked by concerns about cost control and the economic impact of hosting the Olympics. Paris 2024 is projected to have cost around $8.7 billion, with significant investments in infrastructure and security. The legacy of previous Olympics has shown that investing in infrastructure can have positive effects on local economies, but evidence suggests that success in the Olympics does not necessarily boost public participation in sport.\\n\\nOverall, the 2024 Summer Olympic Games highlighted various issues and trends, including representation, equality, cost control, and home advantage, as well as the economic impact of hosting the games.\""

The games were awarded to Paris at the 2017 IOC Session, with a unique process that allowed both Paris and Los Angeles to bid for the 2024 and 2028 Games. The games will feature several new sports, including breaking, and will be the final Olympics under IOC President Thomas Bach's presidency. The opening ceremony will take place outside of a stadium for the first time in modern Olympic history, with athletes paraded by boat along the Seine. The United States is expected to top the medal table, followed closely by China. The games are expected to cost €9 billion and have broken records for ticket sales, with over 9.5 million tickets sold. Despite some controversies, the games were considered a success upon their conclusion.\""
