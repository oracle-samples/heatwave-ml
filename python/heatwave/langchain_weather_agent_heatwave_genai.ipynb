    "## LangChain Weather Agent with HeatWave GenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build and run a simple, self-contained [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) agent that acts as a \"weather bot.\" The agent is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) running on MySQL [HeatWave GenAI](https://www.oracle.com/heatwave/genai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To orchestrate this, we will use a ZeroShotReActDescription agent. This type of agent uses the LLM's reasoning ability to determine a sequence of steps to solve a problem. It follows a \"Thought -> Action -> Observation\" loop, where it thinks about what to do, chooses a tool to act, and observes the result before deciding on the next step. The agent's reasoning is powered by a custom MyLLM wrapper, which allows LangChain to directly call LLMs hosted in MySQL HeatWave.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goal is to create an agent that can answer the question, \"What is the current weather in Fahrenheit?\". To do this, the agent needs to perform a multi-step task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, it will use a Weather tool to fetch the current weather conditions for its location. This tool gets the temperature in Celsius.\n",
    "- Next, because the original request was for Fahrenheit, the agent will reason that a conversion is necessary. It will then use a Calculator tool to convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how tools can quickly enable a LLM to query live data (the weather tool can be easily replaced with a query to a live database), and how LLMs can use multi-step reasoning to solve complex problems. It also shows how HeatWave GenAI can be easily integrated into any agentic flow created with LangChain.\n",
